Commit #1 :
1) GET and POST functions workig now, db_url in .env file was wrong.

    A) When edit button is clicked, PATCH function adds modified comment into editedDescription array so as to maintain history of edits.
    B) When reply button is clicked, PATCH function adds new reply into replies array.
